When generating or suggesting code, please adhere to the following guidelines:
1. **Code Style and Conventions**: Follow the established coding style and conventions of the existing codebase. This includes naming conventions, indentation, spacing, and comment styles.
2. **Functionality**: Ensure that any generated code is functional and integrates seamlessly with the
    existing code. Avoid introducing bugs or breaking changes.
3. **Readability**: Prioritize code readability and maintainability. Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Include comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
4. **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of the generated code. Aim for efficient algorithms
    and data structures.
5. **Security**: Be mindful of security best practices. Avoid generating code that could introduce
    vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or insecure data handling.
6. **Testing**: Where applicable, generate unit tests or integration tests to validate the functionality
    of the generated code.
7. **Documentation**: If the codebase includes documentation, ensure that any new code is properly documented.
8. **Dependencies**: Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies. Use existing libraries and frameworks already
    present in the codebase whenever possible.
9. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging to facilitate debugging and maintenance.
10. **Version Control**: When suggesting changes, consider the impact on version control history. Aim for
    clear and concise commit messages that accurately describe the changes made.
By following these guidelines, you will help maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure that the generated code aligns with the project's goals and requirements.
